Hello! This is the project for CS409 that I have done.

ROOM:

This is the area that the lesson plan built that I went through, and throughout the lesson, it also had some little portions that were optional additions such as a TV that could be turned on with a remote controller, a mirror that reflects what's in front of it, and other smaller quality of life things for the user.


MINIGAME:

To access this part of the experience, pick up the game controller on the table and activate it to be warped to the area!

This project is a simple interactive game built in Unity using the XR Interaction Toolkit. The player interacts with a button to spawn colored balls and must match them in a specific order. The game features a 2-minute timer, during which the player must match the balls correctly to score points. If a wrong ball is matched, a red "X" appears on the screen for a brief period before resetting the game.

Features:
Ball Spawning and Matching: Players must match balls to a randomly generated color sequence.

2-Minute Game Timer: A countdown timer is displayed in the UI, tracking the remaining time for the player to complete the task.

Button Reset: If the player drops the button and doesnâ€™t pick it up within 3 seconds, it warps back to its original spawn position.

Points System: Players earn points for correctly matching all the balls in the correct order.

Visual Feedback: Incorrect matches result in a large red "X" being displayed for 3 seconds.
